A more interesting Breakout consisting of three levels.

The first level is normal and simple, with 3 lives and three rows of bricks.

The second level has secret bricks that explode into three more balls. The player only loses lives if all balls on the screen are lost. This level starts with 2 lives.

The last level starts the same as the second level, but after scoring 1000 points, the paddle scales down to a super small size. In addition to this, the player is only given one life. If they break all the bricks, they are rewarded with a congratulations screen.

If at any point all lives are lost, the player gets a game over screen.
